# Pay your taxes!

ðŸ‘‰ To do this brief, we were alone and we had 2 weeks. The goal was to create a tax payment site. We had to create an API, and then use it in the front end. We had to use React Next JS and Symfony. We were free to choose our design and our references. It had to be coded with the React Next.js framework and Symfony.

He was expected with the brief:

- A model
- A trello (or other planning management tool)
- Unit tests

## Getting Started Symfony

First, run the development server:

```bash
symfony server:start
# or
php bin/console server:start
```
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started React Next JS

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
