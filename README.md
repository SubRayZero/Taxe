# Pay your taxes!

ðŸ‘‰ To do this brief, we were alone and we had 2 weeks. The goal was to create a tax payment site. We had to create an API, and then use it in the front end. We had to use React Next JS and Symfony. We were free to choose our design and our references. It had to be coded with the React Next.js framework and Symfony.

He was expected with the brief:

- A model
- A trello (or other planning management tool)
- Unit tests
